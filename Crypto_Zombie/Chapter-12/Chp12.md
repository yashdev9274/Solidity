## Chapter 12: Putting It Together

Create a public function named createRandomZombie. It will take one parameter named \_name (a string with the data location set to memory). (Note: Declare this function public just as you declared previous functions private)

The first line of the function should run the \_generateRandomDna function on \_name, and store it in a uint named randDna.

The second line should run the \_createZombie function and pass it \_name and randDna.

The solution should be 4 lines of code (including the closing } of the function).
